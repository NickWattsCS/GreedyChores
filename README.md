# GreedyChores
The purpose of this program is to help users who tend to become overwhelmed by chores, whether daily or weekly. The program is designed to take in a list of chores, or add chores to a pre-exisiting list, and then sort the subsequent list according to a greedy algorithm. The user will have the ability to change the schedule once the algorithm has created it. Eventually, I would like to add support for machine learning for the program to learn the user's preferences and change the schedule based on that if so desired. 

The mechanism of the program is based in two precepts: completing the most arduous tasks first helps someone use the energy they possess at the beginning of the day more effectively, and completing monotonous daily tasks first helps someone use that same energy to push through the mundanity of a chore like doing the dishes.

Currently, this project is planned to be primarily written in Python, with some additional functionality potentially provided by packages of C/C++ code. Since part of the purpose of this program is to help people manage chore lists better, the primary function of the program of sorting list items will not be a strenuous one. Chore lists rarely exceed more than, say, twenty items for the week, and those that do are discouraged by the program. Thus, Python being used as the primary language is acceptable since execution time is not a large concern.
