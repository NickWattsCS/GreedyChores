# GreedyChores
A program meant to schedule the chores for the week using a greedy sorting algorithm. The user will have the ability to change the schedule once the algorithm has created it. Eventually, I would like to add support for machine learning for the program to learn the user's preferences and change the schedule based on that if so desired.
